Abstract

We introduce AccurateRAG—a novel frame-
work for
constructing high-performance
question-answering applications based on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our
framework offers a pipeline for development
efficiency with tools for raw dataset processing,
fine-tuning data generation, text embedding
& LLM fine-tuning, output evaluation, and
building RAG systems locally. Experimental
results show that our framework outperforms
previous strong baselines and obtains new state-
of-the-art question-answering performance on
benchmark datasets.

Introduction

The advent of powerful pre-trained Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs) in recent years has unlocked
new possibilities for many applications (Urlana
et al., 2024). However, relying exclusively on pre-
trained models often limits their ability to accu-
rately respond to domain-specific queries or ques-
tions about up-to-date information and proprietary
knowledge that was not included in their training
data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
emerged as a prominent technique to address this
limitation (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lewis et al.,
2020; Guu et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2024; Yu et al.,
2024; Zhang et al., 2024).

RAG combines LLMs with external knowledge
retrieval mechanisms. Rather than relying only on
knowledge implicitly encoded within the LLM’s
trained parameters, RAG employs an explicit re-
trieval component to retrieve relevant information
from external document collections or knowledge
bases. These retrieved contents are then fed into the
LLM as additional contexts or references, allowing
the model to generate responses grounded in veri-
fied external information. By incorporating exter-

nal retrieval, RAG effectively answers queries us-
ing customized or specialized datasets (Zeng et al.,
2024; Li et al., 2024).

Note that previous RAG papers primarily focus
on proposing RAG approaches (Fan et al., 2024;
Singh et al., 2025), not comprehensive frameworks.
They do not provide modular components such as
a document preprocessor or fine-tuning data gen-
erator, which are essential for end-to-end system
development. Furthermore, these approaches are
independent of the retriever used.

In light of this, we present AccurateRAG, a novel
framework that enables developers to build high-
performance RAG-based question-answering ap-
plications. Our framework offers a pipeline for
development efficiency with all the necessary tools
to process proprietary datasets (e.g. PDF-to-text
conversion with an accurate preservation of struc-
tural content), generate question-answering data
for model fine-tuning, fine-tune text embedding
and LLM models, run evaluations and build RAG

systems, all within a local environment. Addition-
ally, it features an intuitive user interface that al-
lows for convenient customization of the system
and incorporation of the latest models and data.
Experimental results show that our AccurateRAG
achieves new state-of-the-art performance on stan-
dard question-answering benchmark datasets.

2 AccurateRAG

Our AccurateRAG framework comprises four com-
ponents, including: Preprocessor, Fine-tuning Data
Generator, Retriever, and Answer Generator, as
illustrated in Figure 1.

2.1 Preprocessor

Our Preprocessor is designed to handle data cor-
pora composed of documents in a variety of stan-
dard formats, such as PDF and DOCX. Its primary
function is to transform each document within the
corpus into either plain text, as done in most con-
temporary systems, or the easy-to-read Markdown
format, which allows for a more meticulous preser-
vation of structural content.

As an illustrative example, a PDF page as de-
picted in Figure 2 would be converted into a Mark-
In this
down string as showcased in Figure 3.

example, the level of headings and the layout of
the table accurately reflect their source, which is
more meaningful than reading only the textual con-
tent. This demonstrates the Preprocessor’s abil-
ity to maintain the structure and formatting of the
original document during the conversion process.
This step is crucial to guarantee that the content
is accessible and can be efficiently processed by
subsequent components. More specifically, we first
parse documents into HTML using the Unstruc-
tured tool.1 Then, the HTML code for each table el-
ement is refined and converted to Markdown using
a rule-based method. This approach has one draw-
back: occasional typos due to Unstructured’s imper-
fect OCR. To mitigate this, we utilize LlamaParse
within LlamaIndex, another open-source parsing
library that offers higher-quality text but without
table structure.2 By aligning and combining the out-
puts of these two libraries, we gain the benefits of
both and improve parsing performance immensely.
After the conversion, the Preprocessor divides
the parsed data into multiple contiguous context
chunks of comparable length to facilitate further

unstructured

analysis. However, we do not require these chunks
to have exactly equal lengths. Instead, each context
chunk aims to encapsulate a contextual unit. For
an intuitive example, a chunk might be shorter to
only contain a short subsection, or longer to cover
a lengthy paragraph. This strategy ensures that ev-
ery retrieved context carries at least one complete,
uninterrupted piece of information. We also add
to each context chunk a small cut of its preceding
and succeeding chunks. This creates a sense of
continuity that is especially helpful in multi-hop
reasoning use cases.

2.2 Fine-tuning Data Generator

The Fine-tuning Data Generator is designed to au-
tomatically create synthetic data for the purpose
of fine-tuning a text embedding model used in the
Retriever and for fine-tuning an LLM model used
in the Answer Generator.

In this process, we prompt a pre-trained LLM to
generate question-and-answer pairs from each new
context chunk. We prompt the LLM to generate
multiple simple and complex questions from the
given context chunk. Simple questions should be
answerable with a single sentence, while complex
questions may require more detailed responses,
spanning multiple sentences within the context
chunk. The questions should cover different as-
pects of the text to ensure diversity. A further val-
idation step is performed by prompting the LLM
to produce the answer for each generated question
based on the given context chunk. In this step, ques-
tions without answers are removed. This step helps
to confirm that the questions make sense in the con-
text of the provided text and that accurate answers
are available for them, minimizing the chances of
including questions that might seem relevant but
are unanswerable or misleading, which can nega-
tively impact the quality of the training data. Our
synthetic question-and-answer creation approach
thus could expand the training dataset, enabling
the model to handle a wider range of queries and
improve its overall performance.

Here, the generated (context, question) pairs are
employed for fine-tuning the text embedding model
in the Retriever (See the Appendix for examples of
generated questions), and the generated (context,
question, answer) triplets are utilized for further
fine-tuning the LLM in the Answer Generator.

2.3 Retriever

The Retriever component consists of 3 modules:
Semantic Search, Conventional Search, and Re-
trieval Evaluation.

2.3.1 Semantic Search

The semantic search module is to automatically
fine-tune a text embedding model based on the
(context, question) pairs generated from the Fine-
tuning Data Generator, and use the fine-tuned em-
bedding model to find the most relevant contexts
for an input question.

In this approach, we fine-tune a pre-trained
BERT-based text embedding model, such as
bge-large-en-v1.5 (Xiao et al., 2023), using
contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020) with both
hard negative examples and in-batch negative ex-
amples. To identify a hard negative example for
a given question, we utilize the pre-trained BERT-
based text embedding model to retrieve the top
relevant contexts from all context chunks, explic-
itly excluding the corresponding positive context
from which the question is derived. From these
top relevant contexts, we randomly select one con-
text to serve as the hard negative example for the
question. To further enhance the fine-tuning pro-
cess, each batch is constructed with unique positive
(context, question) pairs, ensuring that no context
is duplicated within the batch. For each positive
(context, question) pair in the batch, the contexts
from the other pairs within the same batch serve
as the in-batch negative examples for the question.
This setup encourages the model to distinguish the
positive context from both the hard negative and
in-batch negatives, improving its ability to create
effective text embeddings.

The semantic search module uses the fine-tuned
or pre-trained text embedding model to generate
embeddings for all questions and contexts. To find
the most relevant contexts for a given input ques-
tion, it calculates the cosine similarity between the
question’s embedding and the embeddings of the
available contexts. The contexts with the highest
cosine similarity scores are identified as the most
relevant to the input question.

2.3.2 Conventional Search

The conventional search module, equipped with
the traditional search algorithm BM25 (Robertson
and Zaragoza, 2009), is designed for retrieving
the most relevant contexts in response to an in-
put question. BM25 works by ranking documents

3

based on the frequency of the query terms appear-
ing within each document, based on term frequency,
inverse document frequency, and document length
normalization. When the input question is received,
the conventional search module begins by tokeniz-
ing and processing the question to identify its key
terms. It then compares these terms against an in-
dex of pre-processed contexts that have similarly
been tokenized and analyzed. The BM25 algorithm
evaluates each context based on the frequency of
the question’s terms, applying its relevance scoring
formula to rank contexts according to how well
they match the semantic content of the question.

2.3.3 Retrieval Evaluation

The retrieval evaluation module assesses various
search strategies, including semantic search only,
conventional search only, and a hybrid search ap-
proach that integrates the top relevant outputs from
both semantic and conventional search modules via
reciprocal rank fusion (Cormack et al., 2009). This
assessment is conducted using a validation set. The
module then identifies the most effective search
strategy by selecting the one that achieves the high-
est retrieval score on the validation set. The chosen
strategy is subsequently used by the Retriever to
find the top most relevant contexts in response to a
given question.

2.4 Answer Generator

The Answer Generator consists of two modules:
Answer Synthesis and Answer Evaluation.

2.4.1 Answer Synthesis

The answer synthesis module automatically fine-
tunes a pre-trained LLM using ("expanded" context,
question, answer) triplets. These triplets are created
by combining outputs from the Fine-tuning Data
Generator with those from the Retriever. Specif-
ically, for each question in a (context, question,
answer) triplet from the Fine-tuning Data Gener-
ator, the Retriever is used to identify the top-N-1
most relevant contexts from the entire set of context
chunks, explicitly excluding the original context as-
sociated with the question. The original context and
the top-N-1 relevant contexts for the given question
are unified and shuffled to form the "expanded"
context. This process results in ("expanded" con-
text, question, answer) triplets that are used for
fine-tuning. The answer synthesis utilizes the effi-
cient fine-tuning method LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) to
fine-tune the pre-trained LLM on these triplets.

You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to
determine whether the [Generated Answer]
is factually accurate based on the [Query]
and the [Ground Truth Answer].
[Query]: {query}
[Ground Truth Answer]: {ground truth an-
swer}
[Generated Answer]: {generated answer}
## Instructions:
- Focus only on factual accuracy — ignore
style, tone, or completeness.
- The Generated Answer is accurate if it
includes all key facts from the Ground Truth
Answer.
- The Generated Answer is inaccurate if
it contradicts or omits key facts from the
Ground Truth Answer.
- Differences in wording, sentence structure,
or inclusion of additional context are accept-
able.
Respond with only "TRUE" if the Gen-
erated Answer is accurate, and with only
"FALSE" if it is inaccurate.

Figure 4: Answer judgment prompt.

The answer synthesis module employs the fine-
tuned LLM (or even the original pre-trained LLM)
to generate an answer for a new question based on
the concatenation of the top-N relevant contexts
provided by the Retriever for the new question.

2.4.2 Answer Evaluation
The answer evaluation module is designed to use
a pre-trained LLM (the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
model by default) as a judge to evaluate the correct-
ness of the generated answer (Zheng et al., 2023).
Figure 4 shows the prompt used for this module.

2.5 User Interface

We also provide a User Interface (UI) to make run-
ning AccurateRAG straightforward and efficient,
making it more accessible to RAG developers who
may not be familiar with command-line operations.
Figure 5 shows the UI for the Preprocessor com-
ponent and text embedding model fine-tuning in
the semantic search module, while Figure 6 shows
the UI for LLM fine-tuning in the answer synthesis
module. The "Evaluate" and "Q&A" tabs in both
Figures 5 and 6, though very standard in concept,
are designed to support developers in benchmark

analysis and interactive QA demonstrations, respec-
tively, ensuring practical usability in real-world
scenarios. The remaining modules or components
operate in the back-end when triggered. In addi-
tion, when a fine-tuning process is initiated, the
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019)
is employed to facilitate the fine-tuning.

More specifically, as shown in Figure 5, develop-
ers begin by uploading a private raw data corpus of
document files. They then select a pre-trained text
embedding model, such as the local folder path of
an available BERT-based model or a model identi-
fier from Hugging Face, and specify the fine-tuning
hyper-parameters. Upon clicking the "Start" but-

ton, the framework first initiates the Preprocessor
and subsequently the Fine-tuning Data Generator
in the back-end to create context chunks as well as
fine-tuning examples. Following this, the seman-
tic search module is executed to fine-tune the text
embedding model.

As depicted in Figure 6, once the text embedding
model fine-tuning is complete, developers select a
pre-trained LLM and specify the LLM fine-tuning
hyperparameters. Upon clicking the "Start" button,
the framework first initiates the Retriever, which
combines its output with the output from the Fine-
tuning Data Generator to create ("expanded" con-
text, question, answer) triplet examples for fine-

tuning the LLM, and then executes the LLM fine-
tuning process.

3 Evaluation

3.1 General Setup

For all our experiments in this section, we employ
two A100 40GB GPUs, running for 3 epochs on
training sets with 10% warm-up steps. For fine-
tuning the embedding model, we use a fixed learn-
ing rate of 1e-5 and a global batch size of 16. We
fine-tune LLMs with LoRA adapters with rank 32,
using a fixed learning rate of 5e-5 and a global
batch size of 64.

Impact of Preprocessor and Fine-tuning
Data Generator

The

pre-trained

We evaluate our AccurateRAG on the domain-
specific FinanceBench benchmark (Islam et al.,
2023). The public FinanceBench consists of 150
manually curated question-answer pairs derived
from about 80 long financial report PDFs. Avail-
able only as a test set, it serves as a typical example
that mimics real-world use cases. The benchmark
is challenging, as evidenced by the baseline sys-
tem using the OpenAI’s ada embedding model and
GPT-4-turbo, which achieves only 19% accuracy.
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
(Grattafiori et al., 2024) is used as the LLM in
the AccurateRAG’s Fine-tuning Data Generator
component. Our AccurateRAG fine-tunes the
BGE text embedding model bge-large-en-v1.5
(Xiao et al., 2023) using generated data for the
semantic search module and uses the pre-trained
GLM-4-9B-Chat (GLM et al., 2024) as the answer
generator. Note that there is no validation set in
the public FinanceBench, therefore the Accurat-
eRAG’s Retriever component uses the semantic
search strategy only. Our reported scores are based
on manual verification.

As shown in Table 1, AccurateRAG achieves

6

a substantially higher accuracy at 42%. An abla-
tion study using the original text embedding model
without fine-tuning shows a 3% decrease in accu-
racy (42% → 38.7%), demonstrating the effective-
ness of our Fine-tuning Data Generator component.
Furthermore, replacing our Preprocessor with the
well-known Unstructured Pre-Processing Tool for
PDF-to-text conversion results in a 4% accuracy
drop (38.7% → 34.7%), confirming the superior
performance of our Preprocessor.

3.3

Impact of Model Fine-tuning

Table 1 also presents the effectiveness of fine-
tuning the text embedding model with generated
data. In this subsection, we further evaluate the
effectiveness of fine-tuning both text embedding
and LLM models, without generated data.

We evaluate AccurateRAG on 5 standard
benchmark datasets, including HotpotQA (Yang
et al., 2018), PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), and
APIBench datasets of HuggingFace, Torch Hub
and TensorFlow Hub (Patil et al., 2023), that are
used in the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) system
RAFT (Zhang et al., 2024). These datasets already
provide training, validation, and test sets, so we
do not apply preprocessing or generate additional
question-answer pairs. We focus on fine-tuning
embedding and LLM models using the provided
data.

For all these benchmarks, we fine-tune the BGE
text embedding model bge-large-en-v1.5 for
semantic search. Once the text embedding fine-
tuning process is complete, the Retriever compo-
nent determines the retrieval strategy based on
the validation sets:
it uses the semantic search
strategy for both HotpotQA and PubMedQA,
and the hybrid search strategy for the APIBench
datasets. For answer synthesis, we first fine-
tune different LLMs for different benchmarks:
Llama-3-8B for HotpotQA and PubMedQA, and
CodeGemma1.1-7b-it (Team et al., 2024) for the

References

Note that PubMedQA is formulated as a
multiple-choice question-answering task, so cal-
culating the accuracy on PubMedQA is straight-
forward and does not require manual verification.
We compute the accuracy on HotpotQA based on
the exact matching of answer outputs. For the
APIBench datasets, following previous work, we
employ the standard Abstract Syntax Tree match-
ing evaluation script (Patil et al., 2023).

We show obtained results in Table 2. Com-
pared to other systems RankRAG (Yu et al., 2024)
and RAFT, our AccurateRAG obtains notably
higher scores than both systems, obtaining new
SOTA results. Note that our obtained results
with AccurateRAG are based on Llama-3-8B or
CodeGemma1.1-7b-it, while the RAFT system
uses Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) fine-tuned
with Chain-of-Thought answers from GPT-4 (Ope-
nAI et al., 2024).

We further conduct experiments with Accurat-
eRAG based on fine-tuning Llama-2-7B for an-
swer synthesis.
In this setting, AccurateRAG
achieves higher results than RAFT on 4 out of
5 benchmark datasets. Note that RAFT employs
Chain-of-Thought answers from GPT-4. When
RAFT is not fine-tuned with Chain-of-Thought
(under similar settings of fine-tuning Llama-2-7B),
AccurateRAG achieves substantially higher scores
than RAFT: e.g. AccurateRAG scores about 10%
higher on the HuggingFace dataset (68.36 vs.
59.07) and 20% higher on the HotpotQA dataset
(45.71 vs. 25.62).

4 Conclusion

We have presented AccurateRAG—a new frame-
work that provides the necessary tools to help de-
velopers build high-performance RAG question-
answering applications. AccurateRAG outper-
forms previous strong baselines, achieving new
SOTA results on question-answering benchmarks.

indemnification obligation from a 2020 divestiture.
In 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion
related to the split-off and combination of its Food
Safety business with Neogen Corporation. Refer to
Note 3 for further details.

Simple generated questions are as follows:

• How did cost of sales, measured as a percent
of sales, change in 2023 compared to 2022?

• What was the pre-tax gain recorded in 2022
related to the split-off and combination of the
Food Safety business?

More complex generated questions are as fol-
lows:

• What were the major reasons for the increase
in SG&A expenses in 2023 compared to
2022?

• How did R&D expenses change in 2023 com-
pared to 2022, and what were the contributing
factors?

Appendix

Synthesis Data Examples

Given the context:

The Company continues to make investments in
the implementation of new business systems and
solutions, including enterprise resource planning,
with these investments impacting cost of sales,
SG&A, and R&D.

Cost of Sales: Cost of sales, measured as a per-
cent of sales, increased in 2023 when compared to
2022. Increases were primarily due to investments
in growth, productivity and sustainability; restruc-
turing charges, and carryover impact of higher en-
ergy cost inflation partially offset by lower year-on-
year net costs for significant litigation to address
certain PFAS-related matters at 3M’s Zwijndrecht,
Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending disci-
pline, sourcing actions and restructuring benefits.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:
SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in
2023 when compared to 2022. SG&A in 2023 was
primarily impacted by pre-tax charges of 10.3 bil-
lion and 4.2 billion in the second and third quarters
related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Set-
tlement, respectively (both discussed in Note 18).
SG&A was also impacted by restructuring charges
(see Note 5), divestiture costs (related to separating
and preparing the Health Care business for spin-
off) and continued investment in key growth initia-
tives. These impacts were partially offset by 2022
net costs for significant litigation to address Com-
bat Arms Earplugs litigation matters (for which a
pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion was
reflected in 2022, discussed in Note 18), certain
impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manu-
facturing (see Note 17), costs related to exiting
Russia (see Note 17), divestiture-related restructur-
ing charges (see Note 5), restructuring benefits and
ongoing general 3M cost management.

Research, Development and Related Expenses:
R&D, measured as a percent of sales, increased
in 2023 when compared to 2022. 3M continues to
invest in a range of R&D activities from application
development, product and manufacturing support,
product development and technology development
aimed at disruptive innovations. R&D was also
impacted by restructuring charges.

Gain on Business Divestitures: In 2023, 3M
recorded a pre-tax gain of 36 million related to
the sale of assets associated with its dental local
anesthetic business net of a previous contingent
